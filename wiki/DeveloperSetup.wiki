#summary Developer setup instructions

= Developer setup =
Install Java 5 JDK or later. OpenJDK should work, but has not been extensively tested.

Install Eclipse 3.4.1 or later.

Download the target platform zip provided in the downloads section, alternatively create a target platform using vanilla 3.5 Mn downloads from eclipse.org, and extract to a different location than Eclipse's default plugin folder.

In "Preferences/Plug-in Development/Target platform", set the Location path to the root directory created in the step above. Reload.

Get the code from the trunk. (All packages in the trunk root are OSGi bundles, except org.daisy.emerson.install.)

If you get execution environment errors, you need to change each plugins execution environment JRE. (To do this, select properties of The JRE System Library entry within each plugin.)

Create a new Run Configuration. In the Run Configurations main tab, select "Run a Product" and choose org.daisy.emerson.ui.product.

Go to the Run Configurations plugins tab, select "deselect all", select "add required", and then recheck any plugin that is not selected in the workspace area.

You should now be able to run the product.
